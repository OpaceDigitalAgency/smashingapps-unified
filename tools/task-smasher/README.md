## Architecture

TaskSmasher is built on the shared architecture of the SmashingApps.ai platform. For detailed information about the architecture, shared component library, and tool configuration system, please refer to the [main README](../../README.md).

## Configuration

TaskSmasher is configured using the tool configuration system. The configuration is defined in `src/tools/task-smasher/config.ts`.

### Key Configuration Options

```typescript
const taskSmasherConfig: ToolConfig = {
  id: 'task-smasher',
  name: 'TaskSmasher',
  description: 'AI-powered task management and breakdown',
  icon: CheckSquare,
  routes: {
    base: '/tools/task-smasher',
    subRoutes: {
      daily: '/tools/task-smasher/daily-organizer',
      goals: '/tools/task-smasher/goal-planner',

  }
};
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OpaceDigitalAgency/smashingapps-unified.git
   cd smashingapps-unified
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173/tools/task-smasher

## API Integration

TaskSmasher uses the OpenAI API through a secure proxy implemented with Netlify Functions. The proxy includes rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### OpenAI Proxy

The OpenAI proxy is implemented in `netlify/functions/openai-proxy.ts`. It provides:

- Secure handling of API keys (never exposed to the client)
- Rate limiting (configurable requests per IP per hour)
- Error handling and validation
- Response headers with rate limit information

### Rate Limiting

The proxy implements rate limiting of requests per IP address per hour. Rate limit information is returned in the response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed per hour
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: ISO timestamp when the rate limit will reset

### Client-Side Integration

The client-side integration is handled through the shared AI service. This service is used by the TaskSmasher app to make requests to the OpenAI API through the proxy.

## Customization

### Modifying Use Cases

To add or modify use cases:

1. Edit the `useCases` object in `src/tools/task-smasher/config.ts`
2. Add or modify the use case definition, including:
   - `id`: Unique identifier for the use case
   - `label`: Display name for the use case
   - `description`: Brief description of the use case
   - `promptTemplate`: Template for the AI prompt

### Modifying AI Settings

To modify AI settings:

1. Edit the `capabilities.ai` object in `src/tools/task-smasher/config.ts`
2. Adjust settings like:
   - `defaultModel`: Default AI model to use
   - `availableModels`: List of available AI models
   - `systemPromptTemplate`: Template for the system prompt

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored securely as environment variables and never exposed to the client
- All requests are validated before being forwarded to OpenAI
- Rate limiting helps prevent abuse and excessive costs
