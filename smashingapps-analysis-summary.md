For example, the following diagram from smashingapps-architecture.md shows the overall SmashingApps architecture:

```mermaid

        subgraph "Shared Services"

            SharedHooks --> useRateLimit
            SharedHooks --> useSettingsMigration
        end
        
        subgraph "Shared Utils"
            SharedUtils[src/shared/utils] --> settingsSynchronizer
        end
        
        subgraph "Shared Contexts"
            SharedContexts[src/shared/contexts] --> GlobalSettingsContext
        end
        
        TaskSmasherApp --> SharedComponents
        TaskSmasherApp --> SharedServices
        TaskSmasherApp --> SharedHooks
        
        ArticleSmasherApp --> SharedComponents
        ArticleSmasherApp --> SharedServices

    subgraph "Tool Registry"
        ToolRegistry[src/tools/registry.ts] --> TaskSmasherConfig
        ToolRegistry --> ArticleSmasherConfig

```

And this diagram from smashingapps-detailed-architecture.md shows the AI components architecture:

        PromptRunner[PromptRunner Component] --> useAI
        
        subgraph "App Identification"
            getAppIdForService --> LocalStorage["localStorage flags:
            - FORCE_APP_ID
            - current_app
            - article_smasher_app
            - article_wizard_state
            - task_list_state"]
            
            getAppIdForService --> URLPath["URL Path:
            - /article-smasher
            - /task-smasher"]
            
            getAppIdForService --> DOMCheck["DOM Elements:
            - .article-smasher-container
            - .task-smasher-container"]
        end
        
        aiServiceWrapper --> getAppIdForService
    end
```

## Key Findings

After a thorough examination of the codebase, I've identified five critical issues that are causing problems with the shared AI functionality:

1. **App Identification Conflicts**: Both apps aggressively set their own app identification flags and clear the other app's flags, with periodic refreshes every 5 seconds. This creates a race condition where the app that refreshed most recently "wins" the identification.

2. **Multiple Model Selection Paths**: There are multiple paths for model selection with different fallback mechanisms, leading to inconsistent model selection between apps.

3. **Settings Synchronization Issues**: Settings are stored in multiple localStorage keys with a complex synchronization mechanism that might not always work correctly.

4. **Usage Tracking Dependency**: Usage tracking depends on correct app identification, which is compromised by the app identification conflicts.

5. **Dual AI Service Paths**: The system has both a modern path (using the registry pattern) and a legacy path (using a singleton service), with inconsistent initialization between apps.

## Solution Approach

The solution focuses on creating a true "single source of truth" for AI services, settings, and app identification, while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Key Components of the Solution:

1. **Centralized App Registry**: A new service that provides a centralized way to register and identify apps without conflicts.

2. **Unified Settings Store**: A single source of truth for all settings with simplified synchronization.

3. **Standardized AI Service Initialization**: A consistent initialization process that ensures all apps use the same AI services.

4. **Enhanced Usage Tracking**: A tracking system that is independent of app identification conflicts.

5. **Updated App Components**: Modified Task Smasher and Article Smasher components that use the new centralized services.

## Next Steps

1. Review the detailed architecture diagrams in the markdown files
2. Review the comprehensive solution plan in smashingapps-solution-plan.md
3. Decide which phase of the implementation to prioritize
4. Begin implementation with the highest priority component
