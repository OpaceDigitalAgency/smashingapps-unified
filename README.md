# SmashingApps.ai Project Structure

## Important Notes on Project Structure

This project has a specific structure that can be confusing:

- The main app is in the root directory (`/`)
- The TaskSmasher tool is in `/tools/task-smasher/`

### File Locations

- **Main App**: Files in `/src/` are for the main homepage and landing pages
- **TaskSmasher App**: Files in `/tools/task-smasher/src/` are for the TaskSmasher tool

### Common Issues

If you encounter issues with the TaskSmasher tool:

1. **File Path Confusion**: Make sure you're editing files in `/tools/task-smasher/src/` and not in `/src/tools/task-smasher/`
2. **Voice Transcription**: The app uses OpenAI's Whisper API through a Netlify function proxy
3. **Routing Issues**: Check the routes in both `/src/App.tsx` and `/tools/task-smasher/src/main.tsx`

### Deployment

The project is deployed on Netlify with a custom domain (smashingapps.ai). The Netlify URL is https://singular-palmier-8967b3.netlify.app/
