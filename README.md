2. **TaskSmasher** (`/tools/task-smasher/`) - AI-powered task management application with various use cases

### Unified Architecture

- The application uses React Router for client-side routing
- Both the homepage and TaskSmasher are part of the same React application
- All routes are handled through React Router
- The app is built as a single SPA (Single Page Application)
